I have created an admin page where there are two buttons. One for managing restaurants and
another for managing food-items. After clicking on the restaurant page, it will redirect to a new page where the admin can add
restaurant details such as name, city and rating. Admin can also delete it. After clicking on the food-item page, it will redirect to a new page where admin can
add/delete food item details such as food type, description, food name and price. There will
also be an add-ons button like this.

I have created a "Select a Restaurant" webpage, where the customer can choose a restaurant,
see its location, and rating. There is a Search Button that helps the customer search for a
specific restaurant or location and it displays it if it is available. The names of the restaurants
are clickable, and when clicked, they redirect to a specific menu created for that restaurant
only. In the "Menu" webpage, the user can select specific food items for that restaurant. Customers
are able to add multiple food items of the same kind, and the "Add to Cart" button shows the
quantity. There are also add-ons for specific food types; add-ons are different for different
food types. The Menu Page also features a search button that helps the user search for the
food items present in the list. There is a "Show Cart" button which redirects the user to the
cart.

I worked on the navigation bar. It consists of 3 icons & the name of the website
“Craft-Your-Crave”. The icons are, home, user-profile & cart. They redirect to their
corresponding web pages when clicked. Also, the cart icon has a red dot with integer number
when there is an item on the user's cart. The number represents the number of unique items.
When clicking the payment button, the delivery page is shown with a nice gif. Under which,
the finalized list of items are displayed.


Conclusion


We were successful in implementing the features and creating the web pages. We were able to
make a website that people can use to order food with a few simple steps. The user can sign
up if new or log in if the user already has an account, then select a restaurant from the list,
then from the restaurant’s menu add their favorite items to the cart. Then, the user is able to
choose their desired payment options and get their food delivered to them.
